def reformat_subway_dates(date):
    '''
    The dates in our subway data are formatted in the format month-day-year.
    The dates in our weather underground data are formatted year-month-day.

    In order to join these two data sets together, we'll want the dates formatted
    the same way.  Write a function that takes as its input a date in the MTA Subway
    data format, and returns a date in the weather underground format.

    Hint:
    There is a useful function in the datetime library called strptime.
    More info can be seen here:

    '''

    date_in = datetime.datetime.strptime(date, "%m-%d-%y")
    date_formatted = date_in.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    return date_formatted
