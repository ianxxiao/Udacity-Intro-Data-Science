    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, let's predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.

    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv

    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.20 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe.
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits
    counts as a way to predict entry counts.

    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~15%) of the data contained in
    turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv. You are encouraged to experiment with
    this computer on your own computer, locally.


    If you'd like to view a plot of your cost history, uncomment the call to
    plot_cost_history below. The slowdown from plotting is significant, so if you
    are timing out, the first thing to do is to comment out the plot command again.

    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are
    hitting the 30-second limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a
    smaller number for num_iterations if that's the case.

    If you are using your own algorithm/models, see if you can optimize your code so
    that it runs faster.
